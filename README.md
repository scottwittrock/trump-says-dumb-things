# Trump Says Dumb Things
Simple express application to display stupid things Trump has said. I created this to refresh myself on how to set up an express server and deployment utilizing Heroku. 



# Development 
To run locally clone the repository and in the folder run the following commands. 
```
npm i
node run start
```

# Deployment
